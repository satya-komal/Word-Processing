# Word-Processing

1.The program reads and stores information from and to text files that contain “stories,” and are held in the program as instances of a new Story class. 
2.Users can
(i) combine two stories to create a new one 
(ii) copy one story to create another identical one
(iii) convert stories to all caps, all lowercase, appropriate capitalization, or Pig Latin
(iv) pull apart and recombine stories and their components (paragraphs,sentences,words).
3.Each instance of Story will contain an ordered linked list of Paragraphs, each of which will contain an ordered linked list of Sentences, which in turn will contain ordered linked lists of Words. 
Story, Paragraph, Sentence, and Word are all new C++ classes that are designed and implemented. Users can manipulate instances of these classes almost exclusively using overloaded C++ operators.

Commands to compile and run the program : Refer to makefile provided in the repository
